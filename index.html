<h2>My Favorite Video Games </h2>
  <p> I like to play <strong>Elden Ring</strong>. Elden Ring is an adventure game. In Elden Ring, you can fight enemies and kill them. And there is weapons as well as armor that you can upgrade to make them a viable option to use in the game. But the game is also hard. Even if you get a lot of good weapons and armor you can still die. But that's what makes this game fun because it makes you want to explore the huge map and find better stuff. And if I were to rate this game, I would give it a 10/10. I highly recommend you play it. </p>

  <p>I also like to play <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. Breath of the Wild is an adventure game where you play as a character called <strong>Link</strong> who is an important character. As Link you can explore, fight, and loot. There are different biomes that have different temperatures that can actually affect you. And the world is huge and you can explore every corner of it. The game is really fun.
